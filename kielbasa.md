Home Screen

This is where you live. You can do any Cooking, Animal and Farm related tasks while on this screen.

Tasks List

Most actions are time consuming and will be done as 'tasks'. These are put on a queue and picked up by characters based on their priority for a given Task Labour (Cooking, Farming, Animal Care).


Kitchen

Here you can cook and eat something during the day.

Food

Healthy eating is vital for survival. No food means no energy regeneration, and running out of energy (especially while on the map) is not a good thing.

Farm

Select and plant crops here. They will grow over time, weather permitting, and eventually will be ready to harvest. Actions here generate Tasks that might take days to finish, and generally require a lot of energy.

Crops

Potato
Your most precious plant, potatoes can be eaten by humans and animals alike. While its not the most nutritious food around, it will fill your belly for a few hours. They can be used to make rough moonshine.
They grow fairly quickly (~100 days), and should be planted in late April or early May. They can grow tenfold, if they will survive the weather during the sprout stage.

Lupine
Pigs love it, but it ain't useful for anything else.
TODO growth details

Wheat
Can be processed into bread or used to feed animals, this is the second most common crop around. Makes decent quality moonshine, too.
Takes forever to grow (300+ days) but can survive most weather conditions. Plant in late September.

Corn
This sweet treat will give you a burst of energy for a short time. It can be given to pigs or turned into a really good moonshine.
Robust crop, but with rather low yeld. Short growth time (120 days), does not like cold weather.

Pigpen
Happy pigs taste better. Keep the building in good shape and keep your sausage ingredients well fed.

Shop
A place to get some bsic supplies and to pay your bills.

Bills
On the 1st day of every month you will get bills that must be paid before the end of the month. Failure to do so is going to have grave consequences...
